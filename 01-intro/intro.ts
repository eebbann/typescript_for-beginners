//first teting javascript in ts

let user : {}  = {name: "John", age: "12"}

console.log('pop it') 
// this will not work because u need to run the typescript to creat js file :
// go to terminal folder part 
// type tsc filename.ts(intro.ts) 
//press enter to continue

//types script is just a form of type checker
